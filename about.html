<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a hardworking and passionate individual currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering. I enjoy solving problems through logical thinking and coding, and I am constantly looking for ways to improve my technical skills. I have a keen interest in full-stack development and love building web-based solutions that make a difference.

Outside of academics, I enjoy reading criminal and mystery stories, which sharpen my analytical thinking. I am also an enthusiastic cricket player and a confident speaker, often taking part in discussions and presentations. Coding is not just a subject for meâ€”it's something I genuinely enjoy spending time on. I thrive in team environments and am always eager to learn and grow.</p>
